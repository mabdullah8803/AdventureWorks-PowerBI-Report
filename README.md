🚀 Bringing Business Data to Life!

📊 Project Overview
 As part of this project, I developed four interactive dashboards using Power BI, each focused on a specific layer of business insight:
1. 📊 Executive Summary Dashboard – This dashboard showcases key business metrics like total revenue, profit, orders, and return rate. It includes visual deep dives such as revenue trends over time, top-performing products, and product return analytics.
2. 🗺️ Geographical Performance Dashboard – Visualizes regional sales distribution across North America, Europe, and Australia.
3. 📦 Product Analysis & Insights Dashboard – dives into monthly orders, revenue, and profit vs targets for the selected product. It even includes a dynamic price adjustment slider to forecast profitability changes. You can also filter the lower chart to track specific metrics like returns %.
4. 📊 Customer Analytics Dashboard - showcasing key insights like total unique customers, revenue per customer, income/occupation-based segmentation, and top-performing customers by revenue. A clean, interactive view to drive strategic decisions.
